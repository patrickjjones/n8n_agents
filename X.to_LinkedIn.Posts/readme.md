X to LinkedIn Automation Workflow Tweet
What This Agent Does:
1️⃣ Scrapes my top-performing Twitter/X posts
2️⃣ Analyzes the core value + message (not just likes)
3️⃣ Rewrites in a tone LinkedIn’s corporate overlords can digest
4️⃣ Removes profanity, keeps the insights
5️⃣ Schedules & auto-posts during peak engagement windows
It’s like a social media interpreter:
📉 Crude tweets in → 📈 Business credibility out
You can adapt this workflow to:
- Repurpose your best content across platforms
- Build a professional brand passively
- Turn ad swipe files into thought-leader posts
Why This Works
- Everyone’s manually crafting “thought leadership” posts for LinkedIn.
