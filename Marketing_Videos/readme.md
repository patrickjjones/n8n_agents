*Video agent that takes trend data, turns it into creative direction, and outputs branded ads—all in under 5 minutes.
Uses an n8n template ("Generate AI Videos with Google Veo3"), replaced the engine with Seedance (a free Chinese alternative), and now this thing pumps out marketing videos while I sleep.
Here’s how it works:
🔁 Send a product idea via Telegram
📈 AI researches 14-day trend data relevant to your niche
🎯 Selects a marketing angle that’s actually hot right now
🧠 Generates AI-optimized video prompts
🎬 Creates 5-second branded video ads using Seedance API
📲 Delivers the video back to Telegram for instant use
Total build time? 2 hour. Total cost per video? $0.03.Speed? Faster than most agencies even respond to emails.
Why this matters:
Trends move fast. Agencies move slow.
Most ecom brands are weeks behind because of revision cycles and “creative strategy meetings.”
This agent catches the wave as it’s forming, not after it crashes.
