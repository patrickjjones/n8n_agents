# Video Agent: Automated Branded Ads in Under 5 Minutes

**Video agent that takes trend data, turns it into creative direction, and outputs branded ads—all in under 5 minutes.**

Uses an n8n template ("Generate AI Videos with Google Veo3"), replaced the engine with Seedance (a free Chinese alternative), and now this thing pumps out marketing videos while I sleep.

## How It Works

1. 🔁 **Send a product idea via Telegram**
2. 📈 **AI researches 14-day trend data relevant to your niche**
3. 🎯 **Selects a marketing angle that’s actually hot right now**
4. 🧠 **Generates AI-optimized video prompts**
5. 🎬 **Creates 5-second branded video ads using Seedance API**
6. 📲 **Delivers the video back to Telegram for instant use**

**Total build time:** 2 hours  
**Total cost per video:** $0.03  
**Speed:** Faster than most agencies even respond to emails.

## Why This Matters

- **Trends move fast. Agencies move slow.**
- Most ecom brands are weeks behind because of revision cycles and “creative strategy meetings.”
- This agent catches the wave as it’s forming, not after it crashes.
