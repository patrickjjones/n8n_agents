Why This Works

Most people overbuild and overthink.
They create 50-node monsters that collapse the moment one tool hiccups.
But this three-node architecture?
It’s simple, reliable, and scalable.
You’re not building workflows.
You’re building 24/7 digital employees — with no burnout, no sick days, and no drama.

Here’s the Play:

Choose a trigger (email, webhook, form, voice, stock update, etc.)
Use AI to analyze/understand/respond
Output a result that moves your business forward

That’s it.
This is how you replace manual labour with scalable, predictable systems that print money on autopilot.
